        <p>
        I am a Full Stack Software Developer with a passion for learning and creating! 
        As a recent graduate of UNC Chapel Hill, I am excited to begin my journey as a Software Developer. 
        While I work well alone, I am also excited to join a team of other dedicated developers and collaborate on projects. 
        I am a man of faith who loves his family. I bring a strong set of ethics, values, and character to the table, along with a fresh perspective and coding skill set. 
        Creativity, time management, and effective communication skills are vital to what I bring into any work environment.
